                    across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection
                    against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as

                <p style=" font-size:larger;">The Chinese garden is a landscape garden style which has evolved over
                    three thousand years. It includes both the vast gardens of the Chinese emperors and members of the
                    imperial family, built for pleasure and to impress, and the more intimate gardens created by
                    scholars, poets, former government officials, soldiers and merchants, made for reflection and escape
                    from the outside world.</p>

                <p style="font-size:larger;">A paddy field is a flooded field of arable land used for growing
                    semiaquatic crops, most notably rice and taro. It originates from the Neolithic rice-farming
                    cultures of the Yangtze River basin in southern China, associated with pre-Austronesian and
                    Hmong-Mien cultures. It was spread in prehistoric times by the expansion of Austronesian peoples to
                    Island Southeast Asia, Madagascar, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia.</p>
